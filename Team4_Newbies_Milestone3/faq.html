			<h3>Are computers bad for your eyes?</h3>
			<p>They certainly can be! Computer Vision Syndrome/Digital Eye Strain is a real issue. Prolonged use of electronics can cause eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, dry eyes, neck and shoulder pain, and degrading vision.</p>
			<h3>What is a strong password?</h3>
			<p>While in years past we thought a strong password consisted of replacing letters with numbers and capitalizing randomly, times have changed! It’s simple for hackers to quickly crack password mutations like these with modern computing power.
				Truly strong passwords are long (greater than 12 characters) and random. </p>
			<h3>How do you dispose of electronics?</h3>
			<p>If at all possible, please don’t throw electronics in the dumpster! There are tons of resources out there for repairing or recycling devices. Any electronics or computer repair shop can let you know if the item is able to be repaired, or
				worth repairing. Repairing your electronics helps reduce the supply and demand for new products, and keeps one more item potentially out of a landfill. If the item can’t be repaired or isn’t worth it to you, another great option is donation.
				As long as the product is in fairly good condition, consider giving it to a person or organization in need. Charities, schools, and senior homes are just a few places that often take donations to repair and give to someone less fortunate.
			</p>
			<h3>What is the Cloud?</h3>
			<p>In its most simple description, cloud computing is taking services (“cloud services“) and moving them outside an organization’s firewall. Applications, storage, and other services are accessed via the Web. The services are delivered and used
				over the Internet and are paid for by the cloud customer on an as-needed or pay-per-use business model.” Basically, instead of storing and accessing programs and files from a computer in your office, you’re storing and accessing them from
				someone else’s via the internet. You don’t need to buy enough hardware to handle everything yourself, you can simply pay for the cloud service. Companies that provide cloud services have huge data centers that are dedicated to this purpose.
			</p>
			<h3>What is IT support?</h3>
			<p>IT support is for when some piece of technology isn’t doing what it should! Far beyond just computers though, IT support people have a huge range of specialized knowledge from phones to fax machines. If you have a problem, you’ll want to
				make sure you find someone who has the right expertise. While they’re often very talented, it’s extremely unlikely that one person will have knowledge of every kind of technology! </p>
